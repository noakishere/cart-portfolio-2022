					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
						Meanwhile is an experimental strategy-idle game, where workers
						<br />
						are hired to your workcamp for a fixed price and they cut logs
						<br />
						which will later be used for different occassions such as selling or
						<br />
						improving the general state of the camp.
						<br />
						<br />
						The reality of these workers is that movement is lethal <br />
						and the player as the employer has to make the decision to either
						<br />
						use them as a means to an end, or to ensure that the workers stay
						alive <br />
						as long as possible, even though they're easily replaceable.
					</p>

					<p>
						This game is an attempt to make a commentary on our <br />
						society's standards of workers' rights <br />
						and to reflect on today's norms of exploitations.
					</p>

					<h3>Technical decisions</h3>

					<p>
						Unity engine has been used to develop and design this game. <br />
						The programming language is C# and multiple programming patterns
						<br />
						have been used to implement the gameflow.
					</p>
					<p>
						Singleton pattern has been used to facilitate the communication<br />
						between the managers such as GameManager, WorkerManager, etc.
						<br />
						<br />
						NavMesh 2d has also been used for pathfinding of workers.
						<br />
						<br />
						State pattern was used to keep track of workers' different states,
						<br />
						and Bus Event Pattern was used to notify the managers of <br />
						different changes during the game.
